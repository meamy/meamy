        <em> Locally bounded enriched categories </em><br>
        <details>
            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                Based on ideas of Freyd and Kelly in [1], the notion of locally bounded category was explicitly 
                introduced by Kelly in [2, Chapter 6], where a given locally bounded symmetric monoidal closed 
                category was used as the basis for a general treatment of enriched limit theories. Locally bounded 
                categories subsume locally presentable categories and a significant number of other examples, 
                including many topological categories and (concrete) quasitoposes that are not locally presentable. As 
                such, the notion of locally bounded category is much weaker than the notion of locally presentable 
                category: for example, a locally bounded category (such as the category of topological spaces and 
                continuous maps) need not have a small dense subcategory or even a strong generator. Nevertheless, 
                locally bounded categories still retain some of the convenient features of locally presentable 
                categories, such as reflectivity results for orthogonal subcategories (see [1, 3]) and results on the 
                existence of free monads, colimits of monads, and colimits in categories of algebras (see [3] and 
                further references therein). The enriched limit theories over locally bounded closed categories 
                treated by Kelly in [2, Chapter 6] generalize the enriched finite limit theories that Kelly introduced 
                in [4], where he also introduced the notions of locally presentable symmetric monoidal closed category 
                and locally presentable enriched category. However, notably absent from the literature has been a 
                notion of locally bounded enriched category that would complete the parallel between the locally 
                bounded and locally presentable settings. <br><br>

                In this talk based on joint work with Rory Lucyshyn-Wright, we define and study the notion of a 
                locally bounded enriched category over a (locally bounded) symmetric monoidal closed category, 
                generalizing the locally bounded ordinary categories of Freyd and Kelly. Along with providing many new 
                examples of locally bounded (closed) categories, we demonstrate that locally bounded enriched 
                categories admit fully enriched analogues of many of the convenient results enjoyed by locally bounded 
                ordinary categories. In particular, we prove full enrichments of Freyd and Kelly's reflectivity and 
                local boundedness results for orthogonal subcategories and categories of models for sketches and 
                theories. We also provide characterization results for locally bounded enriched categories in terms of 
                enriched presheaf categories, and show that locally bounded enriched categories satisfy useful adjoint 
                functor theorems. In addition, we prove some general results for constructing examples of locally 
                bounded enriched categories. We also define and study the notion of an alpha-bounded-small limit with 
                respect to a locally alpha-bounded closed category, which parallels Kelly's notion of alpha-small 
                limit with respect to a locally alpha-presentable closed category. <br><br>

        <em> The Fundamental Theorems of Calculus and Zinbiel Algebras </em><br>
        <details>
            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                In commutative algebra, derivations and integrations (also
                called O-operators) generalize the notions of the derivative and
                integral from calculus. On the other hand, Zinbiel algebras are
                a special kind of commutative non-unital associative algebras
                that capture the notion of riffle shuffle permutations. <br><br>

                Zinbiel algebras and integrations are closely related: every integration
                induces a Zinbiel algebra, and every Zinbiel algebra induces an
                integration. However, these constructions are not inverses! Indeed,
                while every Zinbiel algebra is constructed from an integration, not
                every integration is constructed from a Zinbiel algebra. <br><br>
               
                In this talk, I will explain how an integration is constructed from a
                Zinbiel algebra precisely when said integration comes equipped with a
                derivation, and that together they satisfy the two fundamental theorems
                of calculus. Thus we obtain an equivalence of categories, which
                therefore provides an equivalent characterization of Zinbiel algebras in
                terms of the fundamental theorems of calculus.<br><br>
               
                This story provides a new perspective on "O-operators on associative
                algebras and dendriform algebras" by Bai, Guo and Ni.

        <details>
            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                It is well-known that the subcategory of limit preserving
                functors in the category of presheaves is reflective. But
                what is the exact definition of the left adjoint? In this talk, we
                consider the subcategory of product preserving functors
                (a special case of limit preserving functors) and give a description of
                the left adjoint using some concepts from multi-sorted term algebra.<br><br>

        <em> Presentations and algebraic colimits of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities </em><br>
        <details>
            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                We present a general framework for studying signatures, presentations, and algebraic colimits
                of enriched monads for a subcategory of arities, even in enriched categories that are not locally
                presentable. Given any small subcategory of arities \(j : J \rightarrow C\)  in an enriched category
                C satisfying certain assumptions, we show the existence of free J-ary monads on J-ary
                endofunctors and the existence of small algebraic colimits of J-ary monads, where a monad
                or endofunctor is J-ary if it preserves left Kan extensions along j . We then deduce that
                every signature or presentation generates a J-ary monad, and that every J-ary monad has a
                presentation; moreover, we show that J-ary monads are monadic over signatures. Our results
                subsume earlier results of Kelly, Power, and Lack on finitary monads and finitary signatures
                when C is a locally finitely presentable V-category over a locally finitely presentable closed
                category V. We conclude by showing that our main results hold for any suitable subcategory
                of arities in any locally bounded enriched category.<br><br>

        <em> Minimal Bicategories of Fractions and Colimits of Bicategories </em><br>
        (Joint work with Pablo Bustillo Vazquez and Dorette Pronk)<br>
        <details>
            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                I will present a new set of fractions axioms for a family W of arrows of a bicategory B. Instead of 
                asking for W to be closed under identities, compositions and invertible 2-cells as in the original 
                set of axioms [1], we give a weaker closure axiom, making the family W minimal such that the 
                localization of B at W can still be computed as a bicategory of fractions "using spans with legs 
                in W". We call such a bicategory a "minimal bicategory of fractions".<br><br>

                We know from SGA that we can compute any pseudo-colimit of categories by localizing the associated 
                fibration at the Cartesian arrows, and that if the indexing category is pseudofiltered we can 
                construct this localization as a category of fractions. We can think of this construction as a 
                "categorification" of (pseudo)filtered colimits of sets; when applied to such a diagram it gives a 
                category with the same objects as this colimit, whose arrows witness the germ equivalence 
                relation.<br><br> 

                Using the same strategy, we have computed tricolimits of bicategories as bicategories of fractions, 
                and I will explain how this led to the discovery of minimal bicategories of fractions. Fortunately 
                looking at the SGA case is enough for this: for any fibration, when the base B is pseudofiltered, the 
                family C of all Cartesian arrows satisfies the original fractions axioms, but the "chosen" ones (that 
                is, those given by a cleavage) is a smaller family W that satisfies only the minimal axioms.<br><br>

                For the category of fractions computing the pseudo-colimit, whether your spans have legs in C or in W 
                doesn't really make a difference (you get isomorphic categories), but in a bicategory of fractions, 
                the actual spans (and not their equivalence classes) are the arrows, so different choices of legs for 
                the spans lead to different bicategories. If you want your tricolimit to be a "bicategorification" of 
                the SGA one, then you need your spans to have legs in W.<br><br>

            <summary>Abstract</summary>
		    <p class="abstract">
                History shows that formal foundations for mathematics are worth studying, but, out of sheer impracticality, 
                one rarely hand writes a formal proof. Proof assistants offer at least a partial solution in automation, 
                but there are still serious questions regarding their practicality, most notably the extent to which 
                automation helps, their ease of use, and why we should trust a proof assistant. We will investigate such 
                concerns practically by exploring the Agda proof assistant and discussing my work on a constructive 
                analysis library in Agda.

		    <p class="abstract">
                Estimate safety in an abstract approach to blockchain consensus protocols is formulable in the internal 
                language of a topos. In particular, safety is equivalent to a forcing statement. That is, the estimator 
                in the consensus protocol induces a geometric morphism of categories of copresheaves. Associated to this 
                geometric morphism is a forcing relation between statements in the codomain topos and states in the domain 
                topos [Awodey, Kishida, Kotszch 2014]. Estimate safety is precisely the statement that a given proposition 
                about consensus values (in the codomain topos) is forced by all subsequent protocol states (in the domain 
                topos). The key ingredient in making this work is the cosieves given as part of the subobject classifier in 
                the domain topos. This leads to a completely elementary version of estimate safety using a little internal 
                category theory.
