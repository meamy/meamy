  		<p class="abstract">
		Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca proved in 2012 that a $2 \times 2$ unitary matrix $V$ can be exactly represented by a single-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit 
		if and only if the entries of $V$ belong to the ring $Z\left[1/\sqrt{2}, i\right]$. Later that year, Giles and Selinger showed that the same restriction applies to matrices 
		that can be exactly represented by a multi-qubit Clifford+$T$ circuit. These number-theoretic characterizations shed new light upon the structure of Clifford+$T$ 
		circuits and led to remarkable developments in the field of quantum compiling. In the present paper, we provide number-theoretic characterizations for 
		certain restricted Clifford+$T$ circuits by considering unitary matrices over subrings of $Z\left[1/\sqrt{2}, i\right]$. We focus on the subrings $Z\left[1/2\right]$, 
		$Z\left[1/\sqrt{2}\right]$, $Z\left[1/\sqrt{\mbox{-}2}\right]$, and $Z\left[1/2,i\right]$, and we prove that unitary matrices with entries in these rings 
		correspond to circuits over well-known universal gate sets. In each case, the desired gate set is obtained by extending the set of classical reversible 
		gates $\{X,CX,CCX\}$ with an analogue of the Hadamard gate and an optional phase gate.

		One of the most fundamental aspects of quantum circuit design is the concept of <em>families</em> of circuits parametrized by an instance size. As in classical 
		programming, metaprogramming allows the programmer to write entire families of circuits simultaneously, an ability which is of particular importance in the context 
		of quantum computing as algorithms frequently use arithmetic over non-standard word lengths. In this work, we introduce metaQASM, a typed extension of the openQASM 
		language supporting the metaprogramming of circuit families. Our language and type system, built around a lightweight implementation of <em>sized types</em>, supports 
		subtyping over register sizes and is moreover type-safe. In particular, we prove that our system is strongly normalizing, and as such any well-typed metaQASM program 
		can be statically unrolled into a finite circuit.

		</summary>
		<p class="abstract">
		In this paper, we study the close relationship between Reed-Muller codes and single-qubit phase gates from the perspective of $T$-count optimization. We prove that 
		minimizing the number of $T$ gates in an $n$-qubit quantum circuit over $\CNOT$ and $T$, together with the Clifford group powers of $T$, corresponds to finding a 
		minimum distance decoding of a length $2^n-1$ binary vector in the order $n-4$ punctured Reed-Muller code. Moreover, we show that the problems are polynomially equivalent 
		in the length of the code. As a consequence, we derive an algorithm for the optimization of $T$-count in quantum circuits based on Reed-Muller decoders, along with a new 
		upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the number of $T$ gates required to implement an $n$-qubit unitary over $\CNOT$ and $T$ gates. We further generalize this result to show that minimizing 
		small angle rotations corresponds to decoding lower order binary Reed-Muller codes. In particular, we show that minimizing the number of $R_Z(2\pi/m)$ gates for any integer $m$ 
		is equivalent to minimum distance decoding in $\R(n - k - 1, n)^*$, where $k$ is the highest power of $2$ dividing $m$.

		We introduce Strawberry Fields, an open-source quantum programming architecture for light-based quantum computers, and detail its key features. Built in Python,

		The platform consists of three main components: (i) an API for quantum programming based on an easy-to-use language named Blackbird; (ii) a suite of three virtual quantum computer backends, 
		built in NumPy and TensorFlow, each targeting specialized uses; and (iii) an engine which can compile Blackbird programs on various backends, including the three built-in simulators,

		<p class="abstract">
		We introduce a framework for the formal specification and verification of quantum circuits based on the Feynman path integral. Our formalism, built around exponential 
		sums of polynomial functions, provides a structured and natural way of specifying quantum operations, particularly for quantum implementations of classical functions. Verification 
		of circuits over all levels of the Clifford hierarchy with respect to either a specification or reference circuit is enabled by a novel rewrite system for exponential 
		sums with free variables. Our algorithm is further shown to give a polynomial-time decision procedure for checking the equivalence of Clifford group circuits. We evaluate our 
		methods by performing automated verification of optimized Clifford+$T$ circuits with up to 100 qubits and thousands of $T$ gates, as well as the functional verification of 
		quantum algorithms using hundreds of qubits. Our experiments culminate in the automated verification of the Hidden Shift algorithm for a class of Boolean functions in a fraction 
		of the time it has taken recent algorithms to simulate.

		<p class="abstract">
		We study the problem of CNOT-optimal quantum circuit synthesis over gate sets consisting of CNOT and $Z$-basis rotations of arbitrary angles. We show that the 
		circuit-polynomial correspondence relates such circuits to Fourier expansions of pseudo-Boolean functions, and that for certain classes of functions this expansion uniquely 
		determines the minimum CNOT cost of an implementation. As a corollary we prove that CNOT minimization over CNOT and phase gates is at least as hard as synthesizing a 
		CNOT-optimal circuit computing a set of parities of its inputs. We then show that this problem is NP-complete for two restricted cases where all CNOT gates are required 
		to have the same target, and where the circuit inputs are encoded in a larger state space. The latter case has applications to CNOT optimization over more general Clifford+$T$ circuits.

		<br><br>We further present an efficient heuristic algorithm for synthesizing circuits over CNOT and $Z$-basis rotations with small CNOT cost. Our experiments show a 23% reduction of 
		CNOT gates on average across a suite of Clifford+$T$ benchmark circuits, with a maximum reduction of 43%.

		The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is an important problem in several application domains, including low-power electronics and quantum computing. 
		Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for various metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space required to implement a given 
		function reversibly. However, little effort has been spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular importance in quantum computing. There,

		<p class="abstract">
		We investigate the cost of Grover's quantum search algorithm when used in the
		context of pre-image attacks on the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families of
		hash functions.  Our cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface
		code based fault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area
		metric that costs the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit
		in units of surface code cycles.  As a surface code cycle involves a
		significant classical processing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but
		direct, comparisons of classical and quantum algorithms.

		We exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is
		approximately $2^{153.8}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately
		$2^{12.6}$ logical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{166.4}$
		logical-qubit-cycles.  Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is
		approximately $2^{146.5}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately
		$2^{20}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{166.5}$
		logical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in
		a quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these
		attacks may be as much as $275$ billion times more expensive than one would
		expect from the simple query analysis.

		The Clifford+$T$ quantum gate library has attracted much interest in the

		Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation from the results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm for

		composed of Clifford group and $T$ gates, the latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g., those based on the Steane or surface codes, 
		with the purpose of minimizing both $T$-count and $T$-depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to re-synthesize circuits with ancillae at effectively no 
		additional cost, allowing space-time trade-offs to be easily explored. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7% reduction in $T$-count and up to 87.6%
