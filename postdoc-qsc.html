    <h1>Postdoctoral position in Distributed Quantum Software</h1>
    <p>
    The Quantum Software and Computation group at Simon Fraser University
led by Matt Amy invites applicants for a postdoctoral position in
distributed quantum software and programming. The position is funded by
the NSERC <a href="https://www.qscc.ca/">Quantum Software Consortium</a> led by the
University of Toronto, Simon Fraser University, and the University of
Victoria, along with industry partners Agnostiq, AWS, CMC, IBM, Multiverse Computing, OTI Lumionics, Photonic, and Xanadu.
    
    <h3>A bit about the project:</h3>
    It has become increasingly clear that the eventual path to scalability
for quantum computation and communication lies in distributed
computation at some level of granularity. The goal of the Quantum
Software Consortium is to explore software solutions, algorithms, and
applications of quantum computation in this distributed context.

    <br><br> Your role in the consortium will focus on one or more of the following
areas:

<ul>
	<li><b>Distributed quantum compilation:</b> algorithms for the efficient
compilation of quantum programs to distributed architectures
	<li><b>Distributed quantum programming:</b> formal models for concurrent
quantum computation and the development of general-purpose programming
languages for distributed quantum computation
 	<li><b>Verification of distributed quantum programs:</b> specification,
verification, and simulation of distributed quantum programs and protocols
</ul>
    
    
    <h3>Qualifications:</h3>
    
    <ul>
    	<li> A PhD in computer science or a related field such as mathematics or
physics
	<li>A strong background in quantum compilation, programming languages, formal methods, or concurrency theory. Prior experience in quantum computation is not required, but priority will be given to those with a quantum computing background.
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Duration:</h3>
    Two years, with possible extension up to four years.
    
    <h3>How to apply:</h3>
    Applicants are required to submit
    <ul>
    	<li> A cover letter
    	<li> A CV with list of publications
    	<li> Contact information for 2-3 references
    </ul>
    Please send application materials to Matt Amy (<a href="mailto:meamy@sfu.ca">meamy@sfu.ca</a>).
    <br><br>
    We are committed to diversity and inclusion and welcome candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

    <h3>Application deadline:</h2>
    Applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis until the position is filled.

    <h3>About Simon Fraser University:</h3>
Simon Fraser University's main campus on Burnaby mountain, located just outside of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, is renowned for its world-class research and innovation. With 4 Canada Research Chairs in Quantum information technologies across Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics, Canada Excellence Research Chair in Global Quantum Internet Systems, and the homes of the Quantum Algorithms Insitute and Photonic, SFU aims to be a global leader in quantum technologies.
