	<em>Morphisms of Rings</em><br>
	<details>
		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p class="abstract">
		I will look at the double category of rings with homomorphisms and 
		bimodules as a motivating example of double category. I will discuss companions
		and conjoints. This will lead to “new" morphisms of rings which I think are interesting.
		<br><br>
		Prerequisites: Some familiarity with rings, modules, and categories.

	<em>Separable and central simple (higher) algebras</em><br>
	<details>
		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p class="abstract">
                Most of my talk will be a review of the famous characterization of separable algebras 
                in terms of dualizability/adjunctibility conditions, and of central simple algebras in 
                terms of invertibility conditions, in the bicategory of algebras and bimodules. I then 
                describe my recent generalization of these results in which algebras are replaced by monoidal 
                (higher) categories. 
                <br><br>
                Prerequisites: some familiarity with the bicategory of algebras and 
                bimodules, as explained for instance in the talk by Robert Paré.

	<em>Model bicategories and their homotopy bicategories</em><br>
	Joint work with M.E. Descotte and E.J. Dubuc<br>
	<details>
		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p class="abstract">
		I will present a generalization of the concept of model category to the context of bicategories as well as a corresponding localization construction. The axioms for a model bicategory are a natural generalization to bicategories of those given by Quillen in the sense that they are obtained by requiring the diagrams to commute up to invertible 2-cells, and by considering a 2-dimensional aspect of the lifting properties which relate these families of arrows (in particular, when we consider a category as a bicategory, the two notions coincide: it will be a model bicategory if and only if it is a model category).
                <br><br>
		I will define the homotopy bicategory associated to a model bicategory C, whose 2-cells are given by homotopies in C. I will also describe a fibrant-cofibrant replacement for model bicategories, and, time permitting, I will show how we have proved that this yields the localization of C (in the bicategorical sense) at the weak equivalences. Our proof of this result uses a "transport of structure"; the application of this technique in this context is, as far as we know, a novel method.

	<em> Isotropy Groups of Quasi-Equational Theories</em><br>
	<details>
		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p class="abstract">
In [2], my PhD supervisors (Pieter Hofstra and Philip Scott) and I studied the new topos-theoretic phenomenon of isotropy (as introduced in [1]) in the context of single-sorted algebraic theories, and we gave a logical/syntactic characterization of the isotropy group of any such theory, thereby showing that it encodes a notion of inner automorphism or conjugation for the theory. In the present talk, I will summarize the results of my recent PhD thesis, in which I build on this earlier work by studying the isotropy groups of (multi-sorted) quasi-equational theories (also known as essentially algebraic, cartesian, or finite limit theories). In particular, I will show how to give a logical/syntactic characterization of the isotropy group of any such theory, and that it encodes a notion of inner automorphism or conjugation for the theory. I will also describe how I have used this characterization to exactly characterize the ‘inner automorphisms’ for several different examples of quasi-equational theories, most notably the theory of strict monoidal categories and the theory of presheaves valued in a category of models. In particular, the latter example provides a characterization of the (covariant) isotropy group of a category of set-valued presheaves, which had been an open question in the theory of categorical isotropy.<br><br>

        <em>Reducing CNOT count in Clifford+T circuits on Connectivity Constrained Architectures</em><br>
	Joint work with Vlad Gheorghiu, Michele Mosca, and Priyanka Mukhopadhyay<br>
	<details>
		<summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p class="abstract">

		While mapping a quantum circuit to the physical layer, one has to consider the numerous constraints imposed by the underlying hardware architecture. Connectivity of the physical qubits is one such constraint that restricts two-qubit operations like CNOT to “connected” qubits. SWAP gates can be used to place the logical qubits on admissible physical qubits, but they entail a significant increase in CNOT-count.<br><br>
 
In this talk we consider the problem of reducing the CNOT-count in Clifford+T circuits on connectivity constrained architectures. We “slice” the circuit at the position of Hadamard gates and “build” the intermediate portions. We investigate two kinds of partitioning – (i) partitioning the gates of the input circuit based on the locality of H gates and (ii) partitioning the phase polynomial of the input circuit. The intermediate {CNOT,T} sub-circuits are synthesized using Steiner trees, similar to the work of Nash, Gheorghiu, Mosca in 2020 and Kissinger, de Griend in 2019. Our algorithms have certain procedural differences that also help to further reduce the CNOT-count. In our experiment, we compared the performances of our algorithms while mapping different benchmark circuits as well as random circuits to some popular architectures like 9-qubit square grid, 16-qubit square grid, Rigetti 16-qubit Aspen, 16-qubit IBM QX5, 20-qubit IBM Tokyo. We found that for both the benchmark and random circuits our first algorithm using the simple slicing technique performs much better i.e. gives much less CNOT-count than the count obtained by using SWAP gates. Our second slice-and-build algorithm performs reasonably well for benchmark circuits.

        <em>Generators and Relations for the Group $O_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/2])$</em><br>
	Joint work with Neil Julien Ross and Peter Selinger<br>
        <details>
          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p class="abstract">
          We give a finite presentation by generators and relations
          for the group $O_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/2])$ of $n$-dimensional orthogonal matrices with
          entries in $\mathbb{Z}[1/2]$. We then obtain a similar presentation for the group
          of $n$-dimensional orthogonal matrices of the form $(1/\sqrt{2})^k M$,
          where $k$ is a nonnegative integer and $M$ is an integer matrix. Both
          groups arise in the study of quantum circuits. In particular, when the
          dimension is a power of 2 the elements of the latter group are
          precisely the matrices that can be represented by a quantum circuit
          over the universal gate set consisting of the Toffoli gate, the
          Hadamard gate, and the computational ancilla.

        <em>Breaking down homological cycles of simplicial complexes and the subadditivity property of syzygies</em><br>
        <details>
          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p class="abstract"> 
          The work presented in this talk is motivated by the subadditivity property of maximum degrees of syzygies in a minimal free resolution of a monomial ideal. We give some background for this problem, focus on topological interpretations, and discuss cases where the subadditivity property can be proved from this approach. No prior familiarity with free resolutions will be assumed, they will simply lead us to questions in discrete topology. This talk is based on joint work with Mayada Shahada.

        <em>The four squares problem and its application in operator approximation</em><br>
        <details>
          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          <p class="abstract"> 
		I will first walk through an algorithm of Rabin and Shallit that efficiently solves the four-square Diophantine equation $n=x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2$. The efficiency comes from the use of randomness - there are enough "good seed numbers", so by randomly choosing a number, it is likely that we can hit a good seed that will grow into a solution.  Then, I will explain how this algorithm can be adapted to solve the problem of approximating any $2\times 2$ unitary using matrices of a certain kind. The resulting algorithm is a "baby" version of Ross and Selinger's algorithm.
